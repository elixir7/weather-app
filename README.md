# Weather app
This is an weather application built only with java script using Webpack, Babel, React, Express, Redux and some npm packages.

### Live Demo
A Live demo can be found [Here](http://elixir7.github.io)

### Local Development
If you would like to grab yourself a copy and start hacking on it, follow these steps.
Clone the repo and run `npm install` while beeing in the project folder.
Then run `npm run serve` to start a server at localhost:8080. The script will also compile the files through Webpack. Head over to localhost:8080 in your browser and start hacking.
Since the project it set up with [Hot Module Replacement](https://webpack.github.io/docs/hot-module-replacement.html), you don't need to refresh the page when saving your files. Webpack will process the files, and then only swap out the parts of the application that you changed. The page will not reload which makes sure your content and state stays the same, even after you save a file.
